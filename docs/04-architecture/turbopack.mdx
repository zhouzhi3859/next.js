[Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack) (beta) is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust, and built into Next.js.

## Usage

Turbopack can be used in Next.js in both the `pages` and `app` directories for faster local development. To enable Turbopack, use the `--turbo` flag when running the Next.js development server.

```json filename="package.json" highlight={3}
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbo",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

## Supported features

Turbopack in Next.js requires zero-configuration for most users and can be extended for more advanced use cases. To learn more about the currently supported features for Turbopack, view the [API Reference](/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo).

## Unsupported features

Turbopack currently only supports `next dev` and does not support `next build`. We are currently working on support for builds as we move closer towards stability.
