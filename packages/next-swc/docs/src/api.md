# API references

Turbopack uses code comments and rustdoc to document the API. The full package documentation can be found [here](rustdoc/index.html).

The list below are packages and brief descriptions that you may want to refer to when first approaching the code.

- [napi](rustdoc/next_swc_napi/index.html): NAPI bindings to make Turbopack and SWC's features available in JS code in Next.js
- [next-custom-transforms](rustdoc/next_custom_transforms/index.html): Collection of SWC transform visitor implementations for features provided by Next.js
- [next_api](rustdoc/next_api/index.html): Linking the interfaces and data structures of the NAPI bindings with the actual Turbopack's next.js feature implementation interfaces
